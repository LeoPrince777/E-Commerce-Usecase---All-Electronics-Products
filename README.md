**#Objective:**
This assignment aims to test your web scraping skills, and ability to handle various
types of data (including images) and integrate the scraped data with APIs. You will
also build a system where this raw data is fed to GPT via an API, enabling promptbased queries. The system should be capable of generating data insights based
on these prompts, which will be fetched through a different set of APIs and
displayed to the consumer.
**#Use Case Problem Statement:**
You are tasked with building a system that:
1. Scrapes data from an e-commerce website.[All Electronics Products]
2. Extracts product information such as names, prices, descriptions, ratings,
reviews, and product images.
3. Converts the raw data into a structured format (e.g., JSON) that can be
fetched and served through an API.
4. Implements a separate set of APIs that will receive prompts and return
responses based on the processed data via GPT integration.
5. Processed data will be shown to the user.
